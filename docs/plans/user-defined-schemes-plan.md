# User-Defined Schemes Infrastructure Plan

## Dependencies and Cross-References

### Related Plans

**Wallpaper Generation Improvements** (`docs/plans/wallpaper-generation-improvements-plan.md`)
- Generated schemes will be stored using the user-defined schemes infrastructure
- Shares the same storage location and discovery mechanisms
- Must be implemented AFTER this plan to leverage the infrastructure

**Theme State Management** (`docs/plans/theme-state-management-plan.md`)
- State manager needs to track source types (bundled/user/generated)
- Requires this plan's source tracking implementation
- Can be developed in parallel but integration happens after Phase 2

### Implementation Order

**Priority: 1 (Foundation)**
- This plan provides the foundation for both wallpaper generation and state management
- Must be completed first as other features depend on its infrastructure

## Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, heimdall-cli only supports bundled themes from the embedded assets. Users cannot add their own custom color schemes without modifying the source code and recompiling. This limits customization and prevents users from sharing themes or using community-created schemes.

### Current State
- Schemes are embedded in `assets/schemes/` at compile time
- `scheme.Manager` searches in multiple locations but primarily uses embedded assets
- User schemes can be saved to `~/.local/share/heimdall/schemes/` but discovery is limited
- The system already supports a filesystem-based fallback mechanism

### Goals
- Enable users to drop in custom color schemes without recompiling
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing bundled schemes
- Support multiple search paths for maximum flexibility
- Seamless integration with all existing commands
- Clear priority ordering (user schemes override bundled)

### Constraints
- Must maintain the existing folder structure: `scheme/variant/dark.json`, `light.json`
- Cannot break existing configurations or workflows
- Must work with QuickShell integration requirements
- Should support both JSON format (new) and maintain compatibility

## Specification

### Functional Requirements

**User Scheme Discovery**
- Default location: `~/.config/heimdall/schemes/`
- Support multiple configurable search paths
- Automatic discovery without manual registration
- Same folder structure as bundled schemes

**Search Priority**
- User-defined schemes take precedence over bundled
- Configurable search path ordering
- Clear resolution when duplicates exist

**Command Integration**
- `scheme list` shows both user and bundled schemes
- `scheme get` works with user schemes
- `scheme install` can install to user directory
- Clear indication of scheme source (user vs bundled)

**Configuration**
- New config section for scheme paths
- Support for multiple directories
- Environment variable override support

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Minimal impact on scheme loading time
- Reliability: Graceful handling of malformed user schemes
- Usability: Clear error messages for invalid schemes
- Maintainability: Clean separation between user and bundled logic

### Interfaces
- File System: `~/.config/heimdall/schemes/[scheme]/[variant]/[mode].json`
- Config Keys: `scheme.user_paths` (array of paths)
- Environment: `HEIMDALL_SCHEME_PATHS` (colon-separated paths)
