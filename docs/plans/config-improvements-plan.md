# Config Management Improvements Plan

## Context

### Problem Statement
The current heimdall-cli configuration system lacks proper default handling, discovery features, and user-friendly exploration capabilities. Users must maintain complete config files even when they only want to customize a few settings, and there's no easy way to discover available configuration options or understand their purpose.

### Current State
- Defaults are hardcoded in `getDefaults()` function but not properly merged with user configs
- No descriptions or documentation for config options in the code
- Config command has redundant subcommands and lacks discovery features
- Example config files are in root directory instead of docs/examples
- No visual browser or search capability for config options
- Users must copy entire example config even for minimal customization

### Goals
- Enable minimal user configs with automatic default fallback
- Add comprehensive descriptions for all config options
- Create visual config browser with search and filtering
- Improve config command structure and usability
- Move example configs to proper location with auto-generation
- Make configuration exploration intuitive and user-friendly

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing configs
- Cannot break existing command interfaces (deprecate, don't remove)
- Performance must remain under 50ms for config operations
- Descriptions must be accessible both via CLI and documentation
- Must work with existing viper-based configuration system
